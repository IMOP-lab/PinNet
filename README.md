The proposed PinNet is an advanced polyphase integration network for for skin cancer segmentation. This network combines Morpho-Spectral Harmonic Layer(MSHL) to extract multi-scale bi-domain features and the Dual-perspective attention module(DBAM) for the modelâ€™s lesion detail capture. Empirical evaluations conducted on two public datasets ISIC2017 and ISIC2018 demonstrate that PinNet surpassing multiple existing State-of-the-Art (SoTA) methodologies while substantially reducing parameter size to 50KB and computational complexity to 0.068 GFLOPs.

We will first introduce our method and underlying principles, explaining how PinNet uses multi-scale bi-domain features and attention mechanisms to improve feature extraction from skin cancer images. Next, we provide details on the experimental setup, performance metrics, and GitHub links to previous methods used for comparison. Finally, we present the experimental results, showing how PinNet achieves high performance across multiple datasets.

## Installation
We run PinNet and previous methods on a system running Ubuntu 20.04, with Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.11.0, and CUDA 11.3.

green regions represent the predictions of the models. As shown in the figure, our model achieves prediction results closer to the ground
truth labels in the context of different challenges in skin cancer lesion areas compared to other models.
